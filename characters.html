<h1 class="center-text">Should you play Fox or Falco?</h1>

  <img class="res-img" height="510"  src="images/FoxFalco.jpg" alt="High definition renders of Fox and Falco">
<h3>Fox</h3>

  <h4>Strengths</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Lots of his moves are very fast and strong</li>
        <li>He is also very fast</li>
        <li>This gives him a very strong combo game</li>
        <li>He can use lasers to safely build up damage from a distance</li>
        <li>His down-B is one of the strongest moves in the game due to its speed and versatility</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>He is very vulnerable to combos and chaingrabs, especially on FD</li>
        <li>His recovery isn't the best, and can be easily blocked</li>
  </ul>


<h3>Falco</h3>

  <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>His laser is very useful for racking up damage and interupting an opponents momentum from a long distance</li>
        <li>His down-B is almost the same as Fox's, but it knocks you up, instead of sideways</li>
        <li>His combos are some of the flashiest and most lethal in the game, making games between 2 Falcos exeptionally fun to watch</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Basically Fox's weaknesses but more extreme, he is comboed even harder and edgeguarded even harder than Fox is</li>
  </ul>


<p class="p-offleft">So who should you play? this may be a bit of a copout but whoever you feel more comfortable with, I really enjoy them both but I like Falco more because of his combos, even though many could say the same about Fox. You will never have to worry about not being able to compete because of your choice, as Fox and Falco are the 2 best characters in the game, and always will be.</p>
