<h1>What stage should you play on in Melee?</h1>
<hr>
<h3>In Melee tournaments, there are 6 permitted stages split into 2 categories; Starters and Counterpicks.</h3>
<p>The Starters are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Battlefield</li>
  <li>Final Destination</li>
  <li>Dreamland</li>
  <li>Fountain of Dreams</li>
  <li>Yoshi's Story</li>
</ul>

<p>And the sole Counterpick is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pokemon Stadium</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>The stage shown on the left is Battlefield, the most common stage in tournament play. It is widely regarded as the most Neutral stage of all the Starters as most of the other starters are variations of it, most sets will start here. The other two are the stages that most resemble Battlefield, Yoshi's Story and Dreamland. They all share near identical layouts and the main difference is the proportions of the stages, Dreamland is much larger and Yoshi's is much smaller. However all three stages are known for having flaws. People often get caught on the edge of Battlefeild while recovering, the tree in Dreamland creates gusts of wind that can disrupt the game, and Yoshi's Story has the flying red things pictured that are known for blocking attacks.</p>

<p>The next stages are more divergent from the more standard model, but still starters. There are two of these, Fountain of Dreams and Final Destination. Fountain of Dreams starts like Battlefield but the side platforms move up and down from all the way up to Battlefield height to disappearing into the stage entirely. While Final Destination ditches platforms entirely and is just a long flat platform.</p>

<p>Pokemon Stadium is the only Counterpick in Melee, meaning that it can only be chosen after a loss to <em>counter</em> your opponent. While the base version of the stage is very well balanced, every minute for 30 seconds the stage will transform. These transformations are the oppisite of balanced. These four transformations are dubbed the Fire, Water, Ground, and Grass transformations. </p>
<hr>
<p>The Grass transformation is honestly not bad at all, and would likely be a neutral stage in its own right. But that is where the positives end</p>
<p>The Water transformation has an extremely disruptive windmill on the left, which can be stood on and really just serves as a major disruption to the game. </p>
<p>The Fire transformation has an area, where with precise inputs and timing, you can phase into the stage. The stage also has walls, giving Fox an infinite on many characters.</p>
<p>The Ground transformation has many walls, and an area called "the pit" where it is extremelly easy to trap your enemy along with a massive cliff on the left, creating a super easy place to defend and wait out the transformation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Every character in the game likes different stages, and every player has different preferences as well. But here are some overall tips. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Fox is really strong on Pokemon Stadium, wait out the transformations and don't let him up throw-up air you, as it will kill really early due to the small ceiling.</li>
  <li>The variations in FoDs platform heights really trip up many Foxes as well.</li>
  <li>Falco is especially strong on Yoshi's and Dreamland, but FD is more volatile.</li>
  <li>Marth loves Final Destination, and hates Dreamland.</li>
  <li>Sheik and Jigglypuff do really well on Dreamland and struggle on smaller stages.</li>
  <li>Peach can really struggle on FoD as well.</li>
  <li>Fox and Falco can do really good on FD, but it also makes them very vulnerable to other people's combos as well.</li>
</ul>
